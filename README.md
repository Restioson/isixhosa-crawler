abstract="IsiXhosa is a low-resource language, which means that it does not have many large, high-quality corpora. This makes it difficult to perform many kinds of research with the language. This paper examines the use of focused Web crawling for automatic corpus generation. The resulting corpus is characterised using statistical methods: its vocabulary growth has been found to fit Heaps' Law, and its word frequency has been found to be heavy-tailed. In addition, as expected, the corpus statistics did not match expectations from non-agglutinative languages.",
